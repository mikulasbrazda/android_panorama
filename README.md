# Panorama Android Application

This Android application offers a powerful panorama creation feature, leveraging two advanced technologies: OpenCV and LightGlue. With an intuitive interface, users can easily stitch multiple images together to create beautiful, wide-angle panoramas using either the robust OpenCV library or the cutting-edge LightGlue neural network model.

## Features

- **OpenCV Panorama Stitching**: Utilize the OpenCV library to stitch images together with precision.
- **LightGlue Integration**: Employ the neural network capabilities of LightGlue for seamless image stitching, offering an alternative method to OpenCV.

## Usage

1. Open the application on your device.

2. Select the source images for your panorama.

3. Choose your preferred stitching method: OpenCV or LightGlue. For LightGlue stitching is important to choose firstly left and then right image.

5. The application will display the stitched panorama, which you can save or share.
